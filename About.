SO, Here is my project - SMART RECOVERY SYSTEM its basically works on LOST AND FOUND items !!!
Brief intro---
1. We will sign into the page , If already have an account log in .
2.It will directly takes you into the dashboard page , where you can post your lost or found items with theor time,location ,description , 
image etc....
3.After posting the item , The items will be displayes to everyone on the dashboard page, whereas the items will be in my listings page for the
particular user who posted the items.
we used xampp to connect my database,frontend and backend , where i can see the details of users who logged in and the items whethers it is
lost or found and if the lost item is matched with the found item the user will get a in-app notification .The user can check their items in 
matched items page there we will provide the details of the user !!
